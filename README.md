# Sequence-Based Deep Learning DNA Methylation Prediction and Whole-Genome Epigenetic Aging Prediction

DNA methylation is as an epigenetic regulator of gene expression and has been implicated in cell differentiation, cancer progression, and gene regulation. Recently, methylation of CpG regions was shown to occur de novo in regions related to key developmental genes, implicating its role in the biological process of aging. However, current predictive models of DNA methylation state and aging index suffer from the profound shortage of cost-inefficient manually annotated genomic sequences and a priori defined features. Thus, we developed a proof-of-concept deep learning model to circumvent such bottlenecks, allowing for imputation of missing methylation state by DNA sequence and prediction of an epigenetic age index. Our models leveraged the use of a convolutional autoencoder to learn the latent representations of genomic sequences as well as a series of fully-connected stacked convolutional layers and a Bidirectional LSTM. Overall all supervised learning models achieved accuracy above 80% with future improvements possible by addressing class imbalance. We also trained a random forest regression model for age prediction that was able to learn a high correlation between complete methylation profile and chronological age and outperformed our deep learning model.
